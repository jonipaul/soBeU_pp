Social Belief Updating -Game v02

To do:
- neutral images (not sure person v. RE stimuli)
- Names vs neutral descriptions (Player A,... v Paul, ...)
- First four trials should be high coop for all players (easy fix = trial Round; but best?)
- Adaptive post-10 round questions 
- JS errors (""" quotation marks are an issue) <- does not update on pavlovia (uses the old code)

- instructions (rough)
- moved all text content to the first routine (for ease of translating)
- random intervall buffer

v.01: 2002-2020
