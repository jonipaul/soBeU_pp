Social Belief Updating -Game v02
soBeU

---To dos and issues---
General:
- Code cleaning

Simuli:
- neutral images (not sure person v. RE stimuli)
- Names vs neutral descriptions (Player A,... v Paul, ...)

Run:
- First four trials should be high coop for all players (easy fix = trial Round; but best?)
- Adaptive post-10 round questions 

Pavlovia:
- JS errors
	- dynamix texts 
	- quotation marks ( """ )
	- JS does not update on pavlovia (uses the old code)

- sync errors for github-gitlab-pavlovia (new repository on gitlab ?)
